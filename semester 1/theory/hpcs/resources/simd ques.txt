Design a 2D mesh network of size 3 X 3 for a SIMD computer. In your design analyze all
the possible data routing permutations. Can you deduce it to chordal ring network? If
yes, draw the corresponding chordal ring network and if no, give the justification why
can’t it be deduced to chordal ring network. 

Draw a diagram of 5D hypercube network. In the network label your nodes in binary.
Identify the node degree, network diameter and channel bisection width.

Discuss the multiport memory organization in multiprocessor system

Write a parallel algorithm to sum n values using Shuffle-exchange SIMD model where n
is the number of values to be added and p is the number of processors in the model. It is assumed that the each processor initially holds one of the values among n.

For question 3B, assume Shuffle-exchange SIMD model with n = p = 16. Show how
such addition happens using appropriate diagrams with suitable example. 

Design an interconnection network for a SIMD computer having 16 nodes with the
following routing functions where the address of a node shown is in binary. Also
write the permutation cycles.
βk (an-1 . . . ak+1 ak ak-1 . . . a1 a0) = ( an-1 . . . ak+1 a0 ak-1 . . . a1 ak )

Write a parallel algorithm to sum n values in hypercube SIMD model. Given that
n = p where n is the number of values to be added and p is the number of processors
in the model. What is the time complexity of your algorithm
